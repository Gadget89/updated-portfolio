        <p className="about-content">
          I began my journey to become a software developer in the Fall of 2016. I've had the great privilege to learn from accomplished instructors at The Iron Yard and I graduated from their Front-End Engineering program in February 2017.
        </p>
        <p className="about-content">
          After gaining a solid foundation, I am excited for this lifetime adventure. My curiosity and passion for code continue driving me to keep learning as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p className="about-content">
          I would like to join a great team and be involved in projects that I can be proud of. I invite you to check out my projects and please feel free to contact me.
